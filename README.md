Project Overview

The project aims to analyze a dataset to predict the likelihood of developing asthma based on known factors like age, gender, ethnicity, education level and diagnosis. By using this information, we built a model to accurately forecast the risk of asthma. This predictive tool is vital for for  helping in  better management of the disease. Our team  employed two machine learning techniques for this analysis: KNN and logistic regression.

Methodologies used:
1. KNN targets  to classify data points based on their proximity to other points in the dataset.
2. Logistic Regression aiming  to predicts the probability of asthma occurrence by modeling the relationship between the dependent variable (diagnosis)  and various independent variables (age, gender, ethnicity and education level).

Rules of Engagement:
1. Transparent and clear communication within the team members.
2. Collaboration and teamwork.
3. Respect and professionalism in sharing different viewpoints and constructive feedbacks.
4. Identifying strong expertise of each team member to effectively contribute to the project.
5. Conducting team meetings and summarizing the key points for discussion on the common shared Google Doc.
6. Transparency in sharing ideas openly.
7. Supporting each other and clarifying if one of the team members has difficulties in understanding the project process.
8. Continuous improvement in developing the model.
