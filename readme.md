Project Overview

The project aims to analyze a dataset to predict the likelihood of developing asthma based on known factors, including demographic details and lifestyle factors. The team employs two machine learning techniques for this analysis: KNN and logistic regression.

Methodology
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Implement the KNN algorithm, which classifies data points based on their proximity to other points in the dataset.
2. Logistic Regression: Implement the logistic regression model, which predicts the probability of asthma occurrence by modeling the relationship between the dependent variable (asthma presence) and various independent variables (demographic and lifestyle factors).

Rules of Engagement
1. Transparent and clear communication within the team members
2. Collaboration and teamwork
3. Respect and professionalism in sharing different viewpoints and constructive feedback
4. Identifying strong expertise of each team member to effectively contribute to the project
5. Conducting team meetings and summarizing the key points for discussion on the common shared Google Doc
6. Transparency in sharing ideas openly
7. Supporting each other and clarifying if one of the team members has difficulties in understanding the project process
8. Continuous improvement in developing the model
